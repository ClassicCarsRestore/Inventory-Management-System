Inventory Management System for Classic Car Repair Shops

Classic cars are currently considered relevant collectorâ€™s items with historical significance and a market with relevant economic impact, with some models being sold for record values. For authenticity's sake,  keeping classic cars as close as possible to when they left the factory can significantly impact their market value. Poor and undocumented restorations can lead to a considerable devaluation of a classic car. 

Previous research work included developing a BPMN-based front-end supporting the referred Charter of Turin to an open-source CRM tool.

A proof-of-concept platform has already been prototyped so classic car owners can remotely monitor and interact with the staff on the physical plant shop floor, following the repair process closely via remotely operated cameras (zooming, panning, and focusing). Also, the shop staff are aware of the operations and state of the repair process of each system vehicle at any moment. This is achieved by instrumenting the plant with IoT sensors to feed the system ubiquitously. Also, prototype studies have been carried out using Blockchain technology.

The next challenge is to work on Georeferencing of body parts on the shop floor for location and warehousing.
